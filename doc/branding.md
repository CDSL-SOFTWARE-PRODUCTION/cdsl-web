**Goal:** Shift from "Generalist Software House" to **"The Ops & Scaling Partner for SMEs"**.

---

## 1. Discovery Phase (Understanding)

*Goal: Aligned with the "Focused Wedge" Strategy (Q1-Q2).*

- [x] **Founder Interview:**
  - **Vision:** Build a high-profit solo consultancy before scaling a large team. Focus on "Outcome" (efficiency) rather than "Output" (lines of code).
  - **Focus Niche:** SME B2B & Service Business (Agency, Consulting, Education).
- [x] **Buyer Persona Construction (ICP V2.0):**
  - **Primary ICP:** SME/SaaS B2B (10–50 employees, $500k–$2M revenue).
  - **Decision Makers:** Founder, CEO (30-45 years old).
  - **Psychographics:** Tech-savvy enough to understand the value of automation but too busy to do it themselves. Values *speed* and *direct communication*.
  
  **Specific Persona:**
  1. **The Overwhelmed Founder:** Has product-market fit but operations are chaotic. Uses 5-8 disconnected tools. Wants a "Single Source of Truth."

## 2. Strategy Phase (The Bones)

*Goal: Define the "Bad But Good" Voice.*

- [x] **Positioning Statement:**
  - "We help growing SME B2Bs turn fragmented operations into a unified engine for growth using AI-Augmented Custom Systems & Data Automation."
- [x] **Brand Personality:**  
  - **Direct (No Fluff):** We speak the hard truth about your business bottlenecks.
  - **Agile (Speed):** We prefer "Done in 1 week" over "Perfect in 3 months".
  - **Partner (Not Vendor):** We think like a co-founder, protecting your P&L.

- [x] **Tone of Voice:**  
  1. **Brutally Honest:** "Your current process is losing you $X/month. Here is why."
  2. **Educational:** "Thay vì tốn 6 tháng xây app truyền thống, chúng tôi dùng AI để 'đúc' giải pháp custom trong 4 tuần—tốc độ của Low-code, sức mạnh của Custom Code."
  3. **High-Value:** Every conversation must leave the client smarter.

- [x] **Messaging Hooks (Ops Revamp Focus):**
  - *Hook:* "Stop managing your business on 10 different spreadsheets."
  - *Pain Point:* "You don't know your real profit margin until the 20th of next month."
  - *Promise:* "Real-time visibility in 4 weeks or we work for free until you have it."
