## Case Study Details

### Problem
**Services Hospital Lahore**, one of the largest public healthcare facilities in the region, was facing a critical data crisis. With thousands of daily patients, the hospital struggled with:
- **Fragmented Data Systems:** Patient records, staff schedules, and inventory were siloed, making cross-departmental coordination improved.
- **Manual Workflows:** Reliance on manual reporting led to delays, data entry errors, and an inability to track real-time resource availability.
- **Resource Imbalance:** Without visibility into bed occupancy and staff workload, some departments were overwhelmed while others had spare capacity.

### Solution
We engineered a comprehensive **Hospital Data Warehouse** solution to transition the hospital from reactive management to data-driven operations.
- **Data Architecture:** Designed a robust star-schema data model (Fact & Dimension tables) to standardize hospital data.
- **ETL Transformation (KNIME):** Built automated ETL pipelines using KNIME to extract, clean, and merge data from disparate sources (EHR, datasets), ensuring high data quality.
- **Advanced Analytics:** Implemented data mining techniques, including Decision Tree models, to classify patient care needs and predict resource demands.
- **Visualization (Power BI):** Developed interactive dashboards providing real-time insights into:
  - Patient Flow & Bed Capacity by Department.
  - Nurse Shift Distribution & Workload Analysis.
  - Medication Administration & Inventory Levels.

### Result
The implementation provided immediate visibility into hospital operations.
- **Metric:** Transformation of raw data into actionable insights reduced decision-making time for department heads.
- **Metric:** Optimized shift scheduling improved nurse availability during peak hours by approximately 15%.
- **Client Impact:**
