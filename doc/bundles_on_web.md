# High Ticket Strategy: The "Focused Wedge" (2026)

## 1. Core Philosophy: The Solo Consultant Advantage

**Concept:** A "Super Individual" limits capacity to guarantee quality.
**Reality Check:**

* Too many services = Distributed effort, weak authority.
* Long sales cycle = Poor cash flow.
**The Pivot:** Move from "Full-Service Agency" to **"Focused Ops Expert"** (The Focused Wedge). We spearhead with one sharp offer before expanding.

## 2. Top-Down Reasoning: Why "Ops Revamp"?

**The Goal:** Dominance in Vietnam SME Operations Niche.

### Key Factors (Why this works now)

1. **Market Fit:** B2B SMEs (10-50 staff) are drowning in tools but lack processes. They don't need "more code"; they need "order".
2. **Scalability:** Ops Revamp leverages **AI-Augmented Development** to build custom solutions at 10x speed. No "spaghetti code"—just high-performance, tailored logic that scales without the limitations of no-code tools.
3. **The "Leverage" Point:** Fixing Ops creates immediate ROI (time saved, clarity gained), making the "Upsell" to Retainer natural.

### The Cost (The Strategic Sacrifice)

To win, we must pay the price of **FOCUS**:

* **Kill the Alternatives:** We explicitly PAUSE "SaaS Building" and "Data/Quant" offers for Q1-Q2. We cannot be famous for 3 things at once.
* **Lower Entry, Faster Cycle:** We drop the entry price to $1.5k (Diagnostic) to buy *speed* and *trust*, sacrificing early margin for long-term LTV ($45k Retainer).

## 3. Market Positioning: "Bad But Good"

**Core Strategy:** Brutal honesty creates instant differentiation. We frame our "limitations" as the client's "unfair advantage".

| The "Bad" (Weakness) | The "Good" (Reframed Benefit) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **"Em chỉ nhận tối đa 3 clients cùng lúc."** | "Nghĩa là mỗi project em sẽ **trực tiếp làm 80%**, anh/chị làm việc trực tiếp với Founder, không qua junior. Response time < 4h." |
| **"Em dùng Custom Code thay vì Low-code."** | "Nhờ **AI-Agents**, em build giải pháp custom 100% nhưng tốc độ nhanh ngang Low-code. Anh/chị không cần bận tâm bảo trì—em dùng AI để update hệ thống theo quy trình mới chỉ trong vài giờ." |
| **"Ops Sprint chỉ mất 4 tuần."** | "Thay vì dự án 3 tháng chờ đợi, anh/chị thấy kết quả (quick wins) ngay từ **tuần thứ 2**. Hệ thống chạy stable sớm để ra tiền." |
| **"Retainer $2.5k nghe có vẻ cao."** | "Rẻ hơn việc tuyển Ops Manager. Anh/chị có một Solution Architect hiểu kinh doanh — người có 5 năm thực chiến vận hành và 2 năm dùng AI để 'code' hóa các quy trình đó." |

## 5. Go-To-Market: The Minimalist Path (Q1-Q2)

**Strategy:** Ignore complex funnels. Focus on direct relationships and "Proof".

### A. The Content Funnel (LinkedIn)

* **Frequency:** Only 1 Post every 2 weeks. Quality > Quantity.
* **Format:** "Micro Case Study" (Before -> After).
  * *Example:* "Client X (30 staff) saved 20 hrs/week by automating lead assignment. Here is the exact logic I used."
* **Goal:** Demonstrate "competence", not just "knowledge".

### B. The Workshop (Monthly)

* **Topic:** "Ops Scorecard Audit" (15 mins).
* **Goal:** Convert attendees to Tier 1 Diagnostic.

## 6. Radical Affiliate Strategy (Win-Win-Win)

**Philosophy:** Make partners feel "stupid" for not referring.

* **Tier 1 (Cash):** **$500 Cash** immediately upon closing a $12k+ deal.
* **Tier 2 (Recurring):** Refer 3+ clients/year? Get **10% of their Retainer fee** forever. (Passive Income Asset).
* **Tier 3 (VC/Incubator):** We give your portfolio startups a **20% Discount**. You look like a hero for finding them a great vendor.

## 7. The Roadmap to #1

* **Phase 2 (Q2):** Build Case Studies. Start Monthly Workshops. 3 New Clients.
* **Phase 3 (Q3+):** Scale Retainers. Only THEN consider re-introducing SaaS/Data offers.
